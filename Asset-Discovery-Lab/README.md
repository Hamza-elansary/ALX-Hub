# Asset-Discovery-Lab 
## Background
It's time to learn about asset discovery. Using various techniques, we'll use the [digi.ninja](https://digi.ninja/projects/zonetransferme.php) website for testing. 

## Objective
Understand various levels of assets, from DNS records to FQDN (Fully Qualified Domain Names) with subdomains, and learn to use different tools for comprehensive asset enumeration.

## Scope
Note you are only expected to do the challenges under the banner Asset Discovery. Moving too far ahead prematurely could lead to knowledge gaps that will make it more challenging to link the theory to the practical component.

## Challenge Overview
This section contains 6 tasks focused on asset discovery techniques:

    - DNS Dig
    - DNS Nslookup
    - DNS Zone Transfer
    - Subfinder
    - Amass
    - Shodan
